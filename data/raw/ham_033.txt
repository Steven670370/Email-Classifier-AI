Hello,
I wanted to inform you that I will be out of the office this Friday. During this time, I may have limited access to email, but I will respond to any urgent matters as soon as possible.
If there’s anything that requires attention before Friday, please let me know so I can address it in advance.
Thank you for your understanding.
Best regards,
