Dear Team,
I hope you’re doing well. I am pleased to announce that we have a new member joining our team this week. Please join me in giving them a warm welcome and helping them feel comfortable as they get settled in.
We are excited to have [New Member’s Name] on board and look forward to their contributions. If you have any questions or would like to reach out to introduce yourself, feel free to do so.
Thank you all for your support in making our new colleague feel at home.
Best regards,
