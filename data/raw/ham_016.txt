Hi,
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to inform you that I will be working from home tomorrow. 
I will be available via email and phone if anything urgent comes up.
Thank you for your understanding, and please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to prioritize while working remotely.
Best regards,
