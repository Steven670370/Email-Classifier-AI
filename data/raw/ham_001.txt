Hey,
I hope you’re doing well. 
I was wondering if you could kindly send me the notes from yesterday’s class. 
I wasn’t able to take down everything, and having your notes would really help me catch up and make sure I understand the material properly.
I really appreciate your help with this, and thank you in advance for taking the time to share them with me.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
